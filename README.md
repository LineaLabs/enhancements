# Lineapy Enhancements

A surface for discussing new features with external collaborations.

All suggestions will be through a pull request, and the document should have:

* High level motivations
* A set of examples that serves as brain storming and discussion surfaces and eventually test cases
* Finally for a spec of what the expected `lineapy` behaviors will be.
